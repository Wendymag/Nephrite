      <h1>Conclusion</h1>
      <p> We value our clients and we believe that the only way to support them is by working in partnership to fully understand their culture, environment and objectives. This enables us to provide truly tailored consultative staffing solutions, no matter what the extent of their recruitment needs may be. We will not submit a candidate's profile unless fully assured that there is a very good potential of the candidate matching clients' needs. Nephrite is particularly aware of the requirements of the Employment Equity Act and other current legislation that has made it imperative that all recruitment organizations and their clients involved in the recruitment and selection of staff, follow a procedurally fair and non- discriminatory process of identifying the best possible candidates for any position.

In addition, Nephrite has a sound selection capability, which generates candidates through well-constructed advertising campaigns in the right media, coupled with the vigorous analysis of Headhuntingâ€™s own quality database of candidates Nephrite recommends a combination of executive search and selection in order to maximize the advantages of an effective advertising campaign with the use of targeted "headhunting". Nephrite can confidently assure its clients of the highest possible placement success of candidates at all levels. </p>
